If you use limit orders on Binance it doesn't notify you when your orders fill. To add insult to injury when you hit the binance ui and look at order history, orders are ordered by creation date rather than filled date. This becomes completely unusable if you place more than a handful of limit orders at any given time. As a basic work around for now this app simply uses the api to receive notification when orders change state and then sends notifications via email.
